Logarithms
We've encountered some of the most common complexities: O(1), O(n), O(n  )

2

Sometimes big O expressions involve more complex mathematical expressions

One that appears more often than you might like is the logarithm!



Wait, what's a log again?
The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to one.


Logarithmic time complexity
Who Cares?
Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity.

Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.

Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.

...and more!
